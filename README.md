# OverheatingChaos

The main aim of this small, yet brutal game is to work your mobile's CPU to it's core and see how long your device can withstand rendering tens of thousands of chaos inducing sprites! On top of that, when the game is just starting off and all its functionality remains intact, it make for a mesmerizing view of the tiny objects flying and falling!
